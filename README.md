# Blockchain-hash
Simple blockchain implementation in Python to help me understand how the integrity of the blockchain is maintained.

## To Run
Run blockchain.py and follow the console commands to add your own blocks and test the validity of the blockchain.
Changing information in any former blocks will return invalid if a validity test is done afterwards.
